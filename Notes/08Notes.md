# Strict mode
- JS can be a bit more strict through using `"use strict"`
- If you accidentally calla method of constructor incorrectly, JS will produce an error as soon as it tries to read something from `this`, rather than happily writing to the global scope
    - Otherwise, without `"use strict"`, JS will create a global scope object

# Tests
- Build and run collections of tests (test suites)
